# PicBetter

PicBetter is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that helps users evaluate how visually balanced their photos are.
By analyzing brightness, contrast, and lighting balance, the app generates an overall composition score and gives a motivational tip to help users improve their photography skills.

Tools used:
  SwiftUI – for the user interface

  Core Image (CIImage) – to analyze pixel data (brightness, contrast, balance)

  UIKit – for working with UIImage

  Async/Await & URLSession – to fetch motivational tips from the Advice Slip API

  Xcode 15 / iOS 17


Features:
  Upload or preview a photo (using a sample image)
 
  Analyze photo composition in real time
 
  Get a score out of 100 for:
    Brightness (overall lighting)
    Balance (evenness between left and right sides)
    Contrast (difference between dark and light tones)
  
  Fetch a random motivational tip using a live API


Future Additions

  Add live camera capture and real-time photo analysis

  Implement AI-based composition suggestions
  
  Improve score accuracy and guidelines using machine learning models
